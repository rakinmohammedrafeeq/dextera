# Dextera - Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse

**Dextera** is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to control their system's mouse using hand gestures via webcam. Built using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI**, Dextera provides a touchless way to navigate, click, drag, and scroll with simple hand movements.

---

## Features

- **Virtual Mouse Movement** – Move the cursor using hand gestures
- **Left Click & Right Click** – Pinch gestures trigger left and right clicks
- **Drag and Drop** – Pinch and hold gesture to simulate drag actions
- **Scroll Mode** – Raise index finger to enter scroll mode and move hand up/down to scroll
- **Real-time FPS Display** – Displays current frame rate to monitor performance
- **Hand Detection** – Supports multiple hands using MediaPipe’s hand landmark tracking

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV** – For real-time webcam capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe** – Hand tracking using 21 hand landmarks
- **PyAutoGUI** – To control mouse functions like move, click, drag, and scroll

## File Structure

The `Dextera` project is organized for seamless hand gesture recognition:

├── hand_detector.py          # Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe
├── gesture_recognition.py    # Handles gesture logic for click, drag, and scroll
├── basic_hand_detection.py   # Tests hand landmark detection independently
├── README.md                 # Project overview and setup guide

└── Demo.mp4                  # Demo video of gesture controls
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
  *(Note: MediaPipe currently supports up to Python 3.11. See the [MediaPipe documentation](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) for details.)*
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `pyautogui`

These dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How It Works

- **Cursor Movement**  
  The system cursor is moved based on the wrist position using `pyautogui.moveTo()`.

- **Left Click (Thumb + Index)**  
  When the thumb and index fingertip come close together (pinch), a left click is triggered.

- **Right Click (Thumb + Middle)**  
  A pinch between the thumb and middle fingertip triggers a right click.

- **Drag and Drop (Thumb + Ring, Held)**  
  Pinching the ring finger with the thumb and holding it for a short duration triggers `mouseDown()`. Releasing ends it with `mouseUp()`.

- **Scroll Mode (Raised Index Finger)**  
  When the index finger is raised above the thumb, scroll mode is activated. Moving the hand up or down scrolls the screen accordingly.
